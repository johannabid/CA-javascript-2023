1. I've made two calls two calls to an API provided from https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php?ref=apilist.fun

Actually i made three. Two for loops for index and details. I fetched one single result from the api via id - www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/lookup.php?i=11007. Which is showed on singleresult.js

I've given styling very little attention.

Both API calls should include a loading indicator.

On the index page i've displayed data from three properties. idDrink, which is the number id of the object which is passed in the query string on the details page. strDrink - name of the drink and last a picture of the specific drink via strDrinkThumb.

Was not able to make a function that prevented "null" values to show / filter the ingriedients - strIngredient. So that's why it's presented like that.. I was not able to create detail pages which only showed each drink respectivly, that's why all the details of all the drinks is shown all at once..

Created a form that follow the inputs and validation rules as expected
